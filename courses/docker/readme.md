# Docker

Welcome to Docker course!

Docker is used to isolate app and its dependencies from host machine. 
So, instead of installing many packages (e.g. `apt-get install ...`) on your server – you can isolate every app 
with only its packages.

Suppose, you have a server where you want to run many applications: Python Flask Backend, Go HTTP API.

With Docker you isolate _Python app_ in one container, _Go app_ into another – and you have clean and nice workaround.

This course introduces you with _Docker_ exercises.
